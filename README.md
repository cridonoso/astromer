 ASTROMER is a Transformer-based model trained on millions of stars for the representation of light curves. Pretrained models can be directly used, or you can finetune on specific datasets. The final goal of ASTROMER is to help in downstream tasks were data is limited to train deep learning models. 


## Requirements
