Welcome to the latest version of ASTROMER. This repository may not be aligned with the [Python Package](https://github.com/astromer-science/python-library), since most of the updates have not been published yet. Source code associated to the paper publication can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/astromer-science/main-code).

## About ASTROMER
ASTROMER is a deep learning model that can encode single-band light curves using internal representations. The encoding process consists of creating embeddings of light curves, which are features that summarize the variability of the brightness over time.   

Training ASTROMER from scratch can be expensive. However, we provide pre-trained weights that can be used to load representations already adjusted on millions of samples. Users can then easily fine-tune the model on new data. Fine-tuning involves training the pre-trained model on new datasets, which are typically smaller than the pre-training dataset.

## Features
- BERT-based masking technique
- Next Segment Prediction available
- Skip connections between attention layers
- Pre-trained weights
  - MACHO R-band light curves
  - ATLAS 
  - ~ZTF~
- Predefined experiments to reproduce publication results (`presentation/experiments/*`)
- Data preprocessing, saving and reading [tf.Records](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord) (`/src/data.py`)
- Dockerfile and scripts for building (`build_container.sh`) and run (`run_container.sh`) the ASTROMER container

## Get started

We recomend to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) since it provides a **kernel-isolated** 
and **identical environment** to the one used by the authors

The `Dockerfile` contains all the configuration for running ASTROMER model. No need to touch it,
`build_container.sh` and `run_container.sh` make the work for you :slightly_smiling_face:	

The first step is to build the container,
```bash
  bash build_container.sh
```
It creates a "virtual machine", named `astromer`, containing all the dependencies such as python, tensorflow, among others. 

The next and final step is running the ASTROMER container,
```
  bash run_container.sh
```
The above script looks for the container named `astromer` and run it on top of [your kernel](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/kernel#:~:text=The%20kernel%20is%20the%20essential,systems%2C%20device%20control%20and%20networking.).
Automatically, the script recognizes if there are GPUs, making them visible inside the container.

By default the `run_container.sh` script opens the ports `8888` and `6006` 
for **jupyter notebook** and [**tensorboard**](https://github.com/cridonoso/tensorboard_tutorials), resepectively.
To run them, use the usal commands but adding the following lines:

For Jupyter Notebook 
```
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0
```
(Optionally) You can add the `--no-browser` tag in order to avoid warnings.

For Tensorboard
```
tensorboard --logdir <my-logs-folder> --host 0.0.0.0
```

Finally, **if you do not want to use Docker** the `requirements.txt` file contains 
all the packages needed to run ASTROMER.
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` on your local python to install them.
